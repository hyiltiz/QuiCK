Full support for vanilla Matlab with GUI and Octave for CLI is no longer on the
TODO list, since these does not provide a unified interface for presenting

TODO:
multiple choice support;
manual encoding as well as automatic encoding based on order;
variable length choices for different items;
better visual interface (fonts, layouts)
importing xls template
